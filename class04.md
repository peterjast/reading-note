# **Structure web pages with HTML**

## Important Concepts

### Structure

* HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) pages are text documents that create the structure of web pages
* HTML uses elements structure the page 
* Elements have an opening tag and a closing tag
* Attributes give more information about elements 
* Attributes require a name and value


### Process & Design

* When designing a website, consider the target audience and what information they would expect to find.

    * Create imaginary users to help dictate the design of your website
    * Who will be visiting your website?
    * What is the motication for visiting your website?
    * What specific goal are they trying to achieve by visiting your website?
    * What information do your visitors need?
    * What are the most important features?
    * How often are people visiting your site and how often do you need to update information?

* Once you know what information you need to appear on your site, you can organize it into sections or pages using a **site map**. 

    * A **site map** is a diagram of the structure of your site
    * You decide how to group information for each page
    * You can use **card sorting** to organize information for each page
    * Organize groups of information to create a flow for how users will navigate your page
    

* Use a **wireframe** to sketch out the design of your site.

    * A **wireframe** is a sketch of the layout of your site
    * It shows the hierarchy of information
    * Shows you how much space each page and section might require
    * Gives you a guide for when you start to code your page

* Use your design to get your message across

    * The goal of a visual design is to communicate
    * Websites have a lot of information to communicate
    * The design shows what information is important
    * Shows users what order to read information
    * Controls the flow of your site
    * A visual heirarchy shows what information should be prioritized
    * Size, color and style control the visual hierarchy - the order in which information is perceived
    * Organization groups blocks of related content together and makes it easier to understand
    * Grouping and similarity helps your page appear organized and easy to understand

* When designing your navigation, consider the following:
    * concise
    * clear
    * selective
    * context
    * interactive
    * consistent

    * article
    * aside
    * section
