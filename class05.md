# **Design web pages with CSS**

## Cascadia Style Sheets

* CSS(Cascadia Style Sheets) can be used to control the design of your web page and make them more attractive
* CSS associates style rules with HTML elements using a **selector** and a **declaration**
    * The **selector** is the element the rule will apply to and the **declaration** 
    * **Declaration** describes the **property** that will be affected and specifies the display setting with a **value**   
* Version control is a system that allows you to store various versions of files as you change them.
* Storing various versions allows you to revert changes and to manage collaborative changes to a file or project.
* Using external style sheets allows you to use the same style rules for multiple pages, but they may also appear within an HTML page

### Selectors 
* UNIVERSAL
    > \* {}
* TYPE
    > h1, h2, h3 {}
* CLASS
    > .note {}
    > p.note {} 
* ID
    > #introduction {}
* CHILD
    > li>a {}
* DESCENDANT
    > p a {}
* ADJACENT SIBLING
    > h1+p {}  
* GENERAL SIBLING
    > h1~p {}    


## Color

* Color can have a huge impact on how your website is received
* Color brings your site to life, conveys mood and can be used to dictate the flow of your website
* Colors in CSS are specified by RGB values, hex codes, and color names
* Color pickers help you find the right color
* To ensure readability of your website, make sure there is enough contrast between text and backgrounds
* CSS3 introduced the RGBA value to indicate opacity
* CSS3 allows use of HSL values with optional opacity value, known as HSLA
