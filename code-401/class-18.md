# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### What are serverless functions?

Serverless functions are functions you can run without a server. You can create serverless functions using serverless compute services from cloud service providers such as AWS and Azure. AWS serverless functions are made possible by AWS Lambda.

### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

I would set up a server and allow users to run their code on my servers.

### Describe how a CDN works

A CDN or content delivery network is a distributed set of servers that are linked together to allow efficient and fast delivery of data over the internet. The servers are placed between different networks to enhance the fast delivery and transmission of data.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Serverless Functions

### CDN

A CDN is a content delivery network or content distribution network. It is essentially a network of servers that are linked together to allows the fast and efficient transmission of data.
