## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

The web request respone cycle is how the internet works. A client makes a request to a server. The request asks the server for access to a specific resource. The server attempts to access the resource and sends back a status code along with the requested resource if the request was successful.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

A server contains a resource, either data or some sort of functionality. When a client makes a request to the server, the server attempts to access the desired resource and returns a status code and a message.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

Deployment is running an application on a server or device or making it available to run on a server or device.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Server

Software or hardware that provides functionality or resources to a client.

### Pub/Sub

An asyncronous pattern used for transmission of data. A publisher writes the data and subscribers listen for that data.

### WRRC

A cycle of requests and responses that allow the internet to exist. Clients send requests to servers and servers send responses.
