# Hash Tables

## Terminology

### Hash

* an alborithm takes a string and converts it into a value that could be used for security or some other purpose

* in a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array

### Buckets

* contained in each index of the array of the hashtable

* Each index is a bucket

* index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs

### Collisions

* what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable

## What Are they

* a data structure that utilizes key value pairs

* every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value

* basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key and quickly retrieve the value through a hash

* hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location

* in the data structure, we can directly retrieve the value

* O(1) time complexity for lookups

## Internal Methods

### Add()

* send the key to the GetHash method

* determine the index of where it should be placed

* go to that index

* Check if something exists at that index already

* if it doesnâ€™t, add it with the key/value pair.

* else add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket

### Find()

* takes in a key

* gets the Hash

* goes to the index location specified

### Contains()

* accept a key

* return a boolean if that key exists inside the hashtable

### GetHash()

* GetHash will accept a key as a string

* conduct the hash

* return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed
