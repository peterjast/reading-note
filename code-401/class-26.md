## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

Angular, Vue, Ember, Meteor, Polymor

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

When using a library, you control the application flow as opposed to a framework, which controls the flow of your application. This is referred to as inversion control.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Rendering

Rendering refers to displaying something in the browser window. In react, you render an element into the DOM using a render method.

### Templates

A template is like a pre-designed guide for how to create something. In React templates are used to implement a UI using re-usable blocks of code.

### State

In React, state refers to stored properties that belong to a component. State is a built in object and
components are dynamically re-rendered when changes in state occur. State represents a components state of being.
