# Bearer Authorization

[<=== Back to Table of Contents](https://peterjstaker.github.io/reading-notes/)

## Write the following steps in the correct order

1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret

1. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party

1. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

1. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

1. Make a request to the access token endpoint

1. Receive access token

1. Receive authorization code

## What can you do with an authorization code?

An authorization code allows you to send information, such as a request for an access token, to a secure resource.

## What can you do with an access token?

Access tokens are used to make API requests on behalf of a user

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

OAuth contains authorization requests, access tokens and refresh tokens and widely accepted as the standard for modern web applications. It is well documented and easy to implement.

### Client ID

### Client Secret
