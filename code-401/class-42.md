### [The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

*By Bill Souror*

Right from the jump, this situation presented is in violation of ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct principle 1.3(Be honest and trustworthy) as well as principle 2.2(Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice), principle 3.1(Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work). Bill Sourer was working at an interactive marketing firm founded by a medical doctor. Many of its clients were large pharmaceuitical companies. To get around strict pharmaceutical advertising regulations in Canada, this firm set up targeted advertisements that posed as informational websites. Souror was tasked with developing a quiz aimed at teen girls to suggest the best possible treatment, but only recommends the client's drug, no matter what answers are provided by the user. Not only did he do so willingly and without a shred of apprehension, but his project manager, who only learned the truth about the questionable quiz because it appeared broken, was also unbothered by the unethical requirements. The PM, Sourer and the client were thrilled with the final product. Everyone was very happy with the website. Everyone besides the users, that is. It turns out, one of the main known side effects of that drug were depression and suicidal thoughts. It took Souror reading a news report of a young girl taking her life, before he put any real thought into the ethicality of it all. Sourer now has to live with the fact that he played a significant role in the suffering and loss of life of young women. They were misled and influenced to take the drug and Sourer and his PM, as the last line of defense, failed to prevent this dispicable monstrosity from taking place. I disagree with the actions, or rather, failures to act that took place, but I agree that developers are often the last list of defense for these kinds of things and need to consciously practice good ethical behavior.

The rapid development of new technologies will transform society. It is crucial that we make the right decisions today, in order to protect society and use technology to build a better future. My favorite part of this article is that it begins with a quote from one of the most brilliant moral philosophers of all time. Kantian ethics along with Kant's dissection of man as a ration being serve as a conduit for any great discourse on morality.

*“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another.”*

—Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?” (1784)

As smart devices become smarter and take strides towards sentience, it is our responsibility to mitigate the risks associated with big data and artifical intelligence. Companies are profitting from big data, supercomputers are surpassing the capabalities of humans, and jobs are rapidly being replaced by machines. Although innovation and technology have potential catastrophic consequences, we can't ignore the potential benefits. Modern technology has created a global community and now more than ever, we have the tools and cability to come together for massive transformative change. Mankind still has a lot of challenges to overcome, but as long as we are responsible and ethical now and moving forward, the potential benefits of innovation are only bound by imagination. I strongly agree that humanity needs to be strategic and responsible when it comes to future innovation.
