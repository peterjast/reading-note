## How to Solve Programming Problems

Code Samples from: [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/) by John Sonmex

### Common Mistakes

* improper allocation of time

* start writing code without taking time to understand problem completely

* try to solve solution on first iteration

### Steps for Algorithm Type Programming Problems

1. Read problem twice

1. manually solve with 3 sets of data

1. manual step optimization

1. pseudo-code or write out manual steps

1. replace with real code

1. code optimization

Allocate up to 70% of time for steps 1-3

### Read Problem Twice

* most important step

* might want to read problem 3 or 4 times

* make sure you completely understand it - you should be able to explain it to someone else

* you can't solve the problem without understanding it

### Solve Manually

* Programming is automation

* Something must be able to be done manually if it can be automated through programming

* solve manually so you know what to automate

* solve with at least 3 inputs

* use mathematical induction - solve for 1, then 2, then n

* write out each step

### Optimize Manual Solution

* figure out if you can cut steps or simplify solution

### Write Pseudo-code or Comments

* skip this step if you have a good handle on problem or previous steps did this

* put steps into editor so you can translate into real code

* this gives you the structure of the code

```javascript
// NewWord = “”

// Loop backwards through word to reverse

//   NewWord += CurrentLetter

// Return NewWord
```

### Replace with Real Code

* convert pseudo-code or comments into real code

```javascript
String newWord =""
for(int index = oldWord.Length – 1; index <= 0; index—)
   newWord += oldWord[index];
return newWord;
```

* you should know how to create a list, sort a list or array, create a map or dictionary, loop throguh list or dictionary, parse strings, convert string to int, int to string, etc

### Optimize Code

* figure out if you can cut lines or simplify code

* make sure variables have long meaningful names

* simplify, get rid of duplication

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

[Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d) by Marcelo Matazarro

* Time is very limited

* people waste time on pointless, low-quality activities

* people value time far less than it's worth

* say yes to things that waste time

* giving away time in unproductive ways can keep you from making a fortune

* imagine each hour is worth $1,000

* you would stop wasting time

* you'd be more productive, focused and effective

* being "busy" inhibits success

* successful people are focused, not busy

* you're on autopilot when you're "busy"

* take charge of your time

* stress and busyness are the enemy

* distractions from what really matters

* successful individuals don't tolerate distractions or busywork

* have a clear vision of your goals

* remove distractions and enter flow states

* cultivate extreme focus for incredible productivity

* your thoughts control who you are and what you can accomplish

* teach people how to treat you and value your time

* treat your time and yourself with respect

* Saying no allows you to have time to do amazing things

* successful people say no a lot and focus on what is important to achieve their goals

## How to Think Like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving

[How to Think Like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/) by Richard Reis

* programming teaches you to think

* more effective problem solving

* problem solving is the ultimate skill

* the best way to solve problems is to have a framework and practice it

### Have a Framework

Steps when you encounter a new problem:

1. **Understand** - fully understand what is being asked

1. **Plan** - plan your solution before diving in

1. **Divide** - break the problem into sub-problems

1. **Stuck?** - Debug, Reassess, Research

### Practice

* solve a lot of problems!

* the more you practice, the more solutions and tools you'll be able to utilize

* successful people practice micro problem-solving

* find an outlet to practice - coding challenges, chess, video games, etc.

## 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

[5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm) by The Mind Tools Content Team

* 5Y is a powerful tool for revealing the underlying causes of a problem

### Origins

Industrialist, inventor and founder of Toyota, Sakichi Toyoda developed the technique in the 1930s.

The method: drill down to root of problem by asking "Why?" five times and then follow through with apparent countermeqasuree to prevent recurrence of the issue

```markdown
The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures,rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.```

### When to Use 5 Whys Analysis

* troubleshooting

* quality improvement

* problem solving

* simple to moderately difficult problems

* not ideal or complex or critical problems

### How to Use the 5 Whys

1. Assemble a Team

1. Define Problem

1. Ask "Why?"

1. Ask again four times

1. Know when to stop

1. Address root causes

1. Monitor your counter-measures
