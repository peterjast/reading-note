# Event Driven Applications

[<=== Back to Table of Contents](https://peterjstaker.github.io/reading-notes/)

## Why is access control important?

Access control is a layer of security that controls resources to data or functionality - it is important because you want to control who has access to sensitive data and who can make changes to things

## Describe an application that would need access control

An education used by instructors and students to submit assignments and keep track of grades such as canvas. As a student, I want to be able to see my grades and assignments, but as an instructor you should be able to see everyones grades and create assignments.

## What is a role used for?

A role is how you assign different levels of access to different types of users.

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Role based access control is easily scalable because you can globally set access rules for different types of users based on their role.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Capabilities

The actions that a user has been granted permission to use, such as crud operations
