## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

Yes, parent components can access the state of a child component using refs.

### What can be passed along in a prop variable?

Prop variables are used to pass data. This can include objects, arrays, strings, numbers and methods.

### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

A child can obtain the state of another component if it passed as a prop by the parent component.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### component props

Component props, short for properties, are JS objects that have been passed from a parent component.

### component state

Component state is a JS object managed within a component. It contains the current state of the component.

### application state

Application state refers to the current state of an application and is easily managed with the state management library, React. Redux is a useful tool to store global state for your application. Recently, application state management has been made even simpler with the addition of React hooks.
