## Terminology

### Graph

a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Vertex

a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices - also called a node

### Edge

a connection between two nodes.

### Neighbor

adjacent nodes connected via an edge

### Degree

the number of edges connected to a vertex

### Undirected Graph

a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional which means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction

### Directed Graph (Digraph)

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed

### Complete Graph

all nodes are connected to all other node

### Connected Graph

all vertices/nodes have at least one edge

### Disconnected Graph

some vertices/nodes may not have edges

### Acyclic Graph

directed graph without cycles

### Cyclic Graph

graph that has cycles
