## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Does a deployed React application require a server?

According to the official documentation, a deployed React application does not necessarily require a static server.

### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

Since React is used to create UIs, React development is usually behavior driven and focuses on the appearance of behavior of the application at a high level.

### What does npm run build do?

It the build script specified in your package.json file to create a build directory containing the production build of your application.

### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

The composition of components is the key feature of React. This means that different components can work together and functionality of a component can be added without impacting an entire codebase. Components are like re-usable building blocks used to compose React applications.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### BDD

BDD is Behavioral Driven Development. An agile development process that relies on human-readable, high-level descriptions of software requirements for testing, development and QA purposes. Having a shared and easily understandable definition for what behavior software should have allows easy communication between engineers, non-technical colleagues and stakeholders.

### Acceptance Tests

Testing software to evaluate whether it meets the defined requirements and behavior and to assess if it is acceptable.

### mounting

In React, mounting occurs when a component is rendered to the DOM.

### build

Build refers to the process of converting source files into a consumable version for production or testing.
