## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe “The Cloud”

The cloud refers to servers accessed over the internet that store resources and software for computing and data storage.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container is like a bundle containing an application and everything it needs to run.

### What is auto-scaling?

A cloud computing feature that allows cloud services to automatically scale based on traffic and utilization.

### What is bandwidth?

Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

They charge based on the amount of usage of their services.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Server Instances

A single instance of a server when it is run on a machine or virtual machine

### Containers

A self contained environment that contains an application and all of its dependencies.

### Cloud Services

Services provided by a cloud service provider such as computing resources and data storage.

### Cloud Architecture

### AWS

Amazon Web Services - a major cloud service provider

### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

EC2/Beanstalk is AWS's infrastructure solution for deploying software. Heroku is built off of these services and is more user friendly in my opinion.
