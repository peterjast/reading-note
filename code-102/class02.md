* A CLI(command line interface) is a text based interface that allows you to type commands to the system and interact with files and directories. You can learn more about the command line [here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php).
* Basic navigation using the command line only requires a few basic commands and understanding of relative and absolute paths. You can learn more about basic navigation [here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php).
