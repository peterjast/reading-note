# **Computer Logic and Architecture**

## Important Concepts

* Computers represent information electronically
* Computers use circuits to do everything
* Compters have 4 main components
* Software is used to control hardware

### What makes a computer a computer?

* Computers are thinking machine with 4 components:
    * input
    * storage
    * processing
    * output
* An algorithm is a series of instructions

###  Binary & Date

* Computer use binary code
    * 1s & 0s that represent true, false 
    * 1-bit is the smallest form of data
    * Using more bits, you can store more numbers
    * You can represent information with numbers

### Circuits and Logic

* Circuits are used to perform calculations and transform data from binary into different data types

### Components

* CPU
* Memory
* Input
* Output

### Hardware and Software

* Software is used to control hardware
* Binary code is the most basic form of software
