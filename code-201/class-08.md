# **Layout**

* div elements are used as containers

* position elements using normal flow, relative positioning and floats

* different devices have different screen sizes

* layouts can be fixed width or liquid

* use grids to make page look good

* block-level elements start on a new line

* inline elements flow in between surrounding text

## Controlling Element Positioning

### Normal Flow

block-level elements appear on a new line

> position: static

### Relative Positioning

moves element from normal position flow relative to where it would have been

> position: relative

### Absolute Positioning

positions element relative to container

> position: absolute;

### Fixed Positioning

positions element relative to window

> position: fixed

*when you use relative, absolute or fixed positioning use z-index for overlapping elements to determine front*

### Floating Elements

positions element left or right within container and allows content to flow around it

> float

*you can create multiple-column layouts with floats*

## Fixed Width Layouts

* don't change as user changes size of window

* gives designer more control over appearance

* image size remains the same

## Liquid Layouts

* pages fill entire brower window

* tolerates user settings and window size

* must account for moving parts

* tend to use percentages

## Layout Grids

* use grids to help position items on a page

* 960 pixel grid is widely used by designers

* creates continuity between pages

* helps users find information

* makes adding content consistent

* makes design collaboration consistent
