Highlights of [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

* While attending an M.B.A. program at Yale, Rachel Rozovsky was part of two small groups with very different dynamics

* One group was internally hyper-competitive and caused a lot of stress

* Other group was friendly and comfortable which led to increased creativity and positive feelings

* Data structured age enables examination of work habits

* "employee performance optimization" isn't enough

* time spent in collaborative activies has increased

* studies show that groups working together "tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems"

* Google focused on building perfect teams

* measured every aspect of employee's lives

* studied frequency of dining companions

* traits shared by best managers - good communication, avoid micromanaging

* 2012 - Project Aristotle - Studied hundreds of Google's teams to determine factors for success

* Dubey, a leader of project, gathered stasticians, psychologists, sociologists, engineers, researchers including Rozovsky

* Very difficult to find patterns in the data

* Project Aristotle researchers concluded understanding and influencing group norms were key

* 2008, researchers from Carnegie Melon and M.I.T. found that best teams have conversational turn taking and had high average social sensitivity

* Psychological safety -  ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up" [Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999.](http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=e55fd191-97da-4b52-a54d-d1ae6abb0a6e%40sessionmgr111&vid=1&hid=115&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=2003235&db=bth) ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’

* Psychological safety was the missing ingredient for Project Aristotle

* Establishing psychological safety makes good teams

* Google's intense data collection and research revealed what great managers always knew

* members listening to each other and showing sensitivity to feelings and needs makes the best teams

* "Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized."

* Having data that tells people that these qualities are important to pay attention to helps bring attention to them
